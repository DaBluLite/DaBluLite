Hey guys, Iâ€™m <strong>DaBluLite</strong> and this is my <strong>GitHub profile.</strong> Here you can find all of my repos, such as:
* My latest BetterDiscord theme, [Cyan](https://github.com/DaBluLite/Cyan),
* The first ever modifiable Discord WebView for Android with JS execution, [SocketWebView](https://github.com/SocketCord/SocketWebView),
* [A template to create your own installer for an AppImage](https://github.com/DaBluLite/appimage-installer-script_base)
* And a modified version of BetterDiscord for Linux that allows you to disable the frame, [BetterDiscordFrameless](https://github.com/DaBluLite/BetterDiscordFrameless)
